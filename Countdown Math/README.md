Countdown Math

This program is a math game where the player is given 6 random numbers plus a target number.
The player must choose two of the numbers and choose if they want to add them, subtract them, multiply them, or divide them to create a new number.
The numbers chosen are removed and the new number takes their place.
The player wins if the target number is in the list of numbers remaining.
The player loses if they have one number remaining that is not equal to the target number.

This program was written under the constraint that arrays were not allowed to be used.
