Countdown Math Undone

This program is a math game where the player is given 6 random numbers plus a target number.
The player must choose two of the numbers and choose if they want to add them, subtract them, multiply them, or divide them to create a new number.
The numbers chosen are removed and the new number takes their place.
The player wins if the target number is in the list of numbers remaining.
The player loses if they have one number remaining that is not equal to the target number.

This project is an extension of the Countdown Math project.
It has been revamped to utilize arrays and classes without changing the original functionality of the game.

The goal of this project was twofold:
  - Add the ability for the player to undo moves made via a stack data structure.
  - Add the ability for the game to show the player the steps needed to beat the current game via a recursive solver.

The undo stack was very simple and straight forward.
The real challenge of this project was implementing the solving functionality.
